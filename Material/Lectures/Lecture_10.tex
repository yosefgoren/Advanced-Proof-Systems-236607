\begin{definition}[Logspace-Uniform]
	We say that \{$C_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is logspace uniform if exists
	a turing machine that on input $1^n$ outputs $C_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	If $L$ is accepted by logspace uniform circuits of depth $d(n)$ and of size $poly(n)$,
	then $L$ has an Interactive proof which the prover runs in $poly(n)$
	time and the verifier runs in $(n+d)polylog(n)$ time with $d\cdot polylog(n)$ rounds.
\end{theorem}
