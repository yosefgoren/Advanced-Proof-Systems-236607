\subsection{}
Given a graph of $vertecies$, 
consider the following series of matrices:\\
\[
	M_k[i,j]:=
	\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{ exists a path from } i \text{ to } j \text{ with length } \leq k\\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\]
Corollary: $M_1$ is the adjacency matrix of the graph.\\
Between any two matrices of size $n\times n$, define the following operation:
\[(A\otimes B)[i,j]:=\bigvee_{x\in [n]}\left(A[i, x]\wedge B[x, j]\right)\].\\

\underline{Lemma}:
\[\forall k\in[n]: M_k\otimes M_k=M_{2k}\].
\underline{Proof}:
Assume (by induction) for $M_k$
\footnote{formally this would not prove for
$k$ values that are not a power of $2$,
but we actually do not make use of those sizes anyways
since $\forall k\geq n, M_k=M_n$ and we only care about $M_n$.}.
Now, we need to prove for $M_{2k}$. Consider a path $l_{i,j}$
from $i$ to $j$ with length $\leq 2k$.\\
It can be decomposed into two paths of length $\leq k$;
The first path from $i$ to $x$ ($l_{i,x}$) and the second path from $x$ to $j$ ($l_{x,j}$).\\
Hence $M_{2k}[i,j]\Rightarrow \exists x\in[n]: M_k[i,x]\wedge M_k[x,j]\Rightarrow (M_k\otimes M_k)[i,j]$.\\
Conversely, if $(M_k\otimes M_k)[i,j]=1$, then there exists $x\in[n]$ such that $M_k[i,x]=1$ and $M_k[x,j]=1$,
which means that there exists a path from $i$ to $x$ of length $\leq k$ and a path from $x$ to $j$ of length $\leq k$.
So $(M_k\otimes M_k)[i,j]\Rightarrow M_{2k}[i,j]$.\\
Finally we have that $M_{k}\otimes M_{k}=M_{2k}$.\\

\underline{Algorithm}:
The algorithm which the circuit will follow is as follows:\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initialize $M_1$ to be the adjacency matrix of the graph.
	\item For each $k\in[n]$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compute $M_{2k}$ by applying the operation $\otimes$ on $M_k$ and $M_k$.
	\item If $k=2^r$ for some $r\in[n]$, then set $M_k$ to be $M_{2^r}$.
\end{enumerate}
